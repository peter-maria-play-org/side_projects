# feed_me

`feed_me` is an ultralightweight python CLI task list system that
abstracts away the decision making process. It operates by creating
a points based task prioritization system. From this system, it
draws a small list of things to do to a user.

## Getting Started

`feed_me` is managed by UV. Once UV is installed, get up and running
with the CLI using following command.

```
uv run feed_me
```

One can also check the test suite of the project with

```
uv run pytest
```

If you see all those tests passing, then you are good to go!

## Project Goals

In this project, we aim to explore the following key concepts:

1. Strong Typing with Pydantic.
1. Linting with ruff.
1. Package Management with UV.
1. CLI with `click`.
1. Creating calendar sensitive codes.
1. JSON files.
1. A basic UI with `dash`.
