# Feed Me
Feed Me is an ultralightweight CLI task list system that abstracts away the decision making process. It operates by combining the pomodoro method for time management with a points based task prioritization system to present a small list of things to do to a user.

Feed Me is written in python and is not performance optimized.

## Getting Started
Feed me is managed by UV. Once UV is installed, get up and running with the 
following command
```
???
```

## Project Goals

In this project, we aim to explore the following key concepts:
1. Strong Typing with Pydantic
1. Linting with ruff
1. Package Management with UV (I DONT LIKE UV :^[)(Switched to poetry!)
1. CLI with `click`
1. Creating calendar sensitive codes
1. JSON files.
